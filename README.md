## Motivation

3D Surround Audio in conjunction to Stereoscopic 3D Video are the most important aspects to create a compelling VR experience to the user.<br>
This is where Ambisonics comes in. Instead of relying on pre-processed audio or virtualized sound sources, the user can capture directly the soundspace and transpose that to the VR World, changing the location of these sources relative to it's head.<br>
HOA4Unity combines the excellent results of Ambisonic recordings, binaural encoding and Unity to create the most realistic sonic experience to the user.
