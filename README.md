## Motivation

3D Surround Audio in conjunction to Stereoscopic 3D Video are the most important aspects to create a compelling VR experience to the user.
This is where Ambisonics comes in. Instead of relying on pre-processed audio or virtualized sound sources, the user can capture directly the soundspace and transpose that to the VR World, changing the location of these sources relative to it's head.
HOA4Unity combines the excellent results of Ambisonic recordings, binaural encoding and Unity to create the most realistic sonic experience to the user.
